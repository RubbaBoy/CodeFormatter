The CLI of CodeFormatter is very easy to use, and has a few different options.                                                                                                                                                                                          
**Singe File** - `node format file-to-format.js` - This formats a single file or directory                                                                                                                                                                              
**Multiple Files** - `node format file-1.js file-2.js directory-name` - This does the same as above, but with multiple of whatever you want                                                                                                                             
**Formatting a Git repository** - `node format https://github.com/RubbaBoy/CodeFormatter true` - This clones or updates the given Git repository and then formats it. The `true` is **optional**, and indicates weather or not it should try and commit & push the repo.
**Adjusting Extra Space** - `node format 5 file-to-format.js` - A number can be put after `format` in any command, and adds an extra amount of space. This is by default `0`
